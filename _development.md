# Assignments

## Re-design midterm: imagine a speculative device

due March 10?

- paper prototyping… see Stuart Candy's related "reverse archaeology" assignment, to "excavate" a device from the future https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305333152_Time_Machine_Reverse_Archaeology

## Final Project: device narrative / supply chain tracking

http://zeitkunst.org/sites/default/files/teaching/CAMS218_SP15_TheoriesOfMediaSyllabus.pdf

- write to Miriam Posner on her "device narrative" assignment for thoughts and updates since 2014. Is she still writing on tech supply chains?

- Evidently you can buy a rare earth mine on the Internet. Anyone looking to make a smartphone from scratch start here: https://minelistings.com/commodity/rare-earth-elements-mines-for-sale/
- Fairphone: "We’ve created the world’s first ethical, modular smartphone.

- Gerd Arntz's ISOTYPE alphabet. "Gerd Arntz drew over 4,000 ISOTYPE symbols which were reproduced by linoleum block prints. His direct and clean graphic style helped set the tone for future symbols in the coming decades. When Otto and Marie [Neurath] fled to England in 1940, Arntz stayed in The Hague and applied his style to symbols for the Dutch Foundation for Statistics." http://www.gerdarntz.org/isotype
- Can use PICOL (pictorial icon language) as a font: http://picol.org/picol_icon_font
- "Design structure matrix (DSM) is a straightforward and flexible modeling technique that can be used for designing, developing, and managing complex systems. DSM offers network modeling tools that represent the elements of a system and their interactions, thereby highlighting the system’s architecture (or designed structure). Its advantages include compact format, visual nature, intuitive representation, powerful analytical capacity, and flexibility. Used primarily so far in the area of engineering management, DSM is increasingly being applied to complex issues in health care management, financial systems, public policy, natural sciences, and social systems. This book offers a clear and concise explanation of DSM methods for practitioners and researchers." https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-structure-matrix-methods-and-applications
- 123D Catch app for photogrammetry: "You feed in some pictures from your iPhone and they get uploaded to the cloud where they’re turned back into a textured 3D model you can explore on your phone or download on your computer. 123D Catch (henceforth also refered to as “Catch”) is part of Autodesk’s consumer-line of 3D technologies which include a product for 3D modeling on the iPad and producing 3D prints."
