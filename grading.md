**20% attendance, participation, reading**

Including potential reading quizzes and in-class activities.

**20% writing exercises**

Students are required to post four total writing assignments to the CourseWorks blog by 7:00 am Tuesday during weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10 of the semester (they are marked in the schedule below).  These updates can take the form of, among other things, a) an explanation, questioning, or complication of the week's readings, b) an update on your final project, or c) an interesting document, resource, or text (primary or secondary) that you've found related to the week's readings.  There are no length requirements.  This is simply a means of reading and thinking alongside one another as we work through these texts.

**30% midterm**

A written midterm exam, due to my inbox on the Friday before spring break (**March 10**), will consist of a selection of conceptual keywords that have emerged throughout the semester.  You will be asked to define these keywords in brief explanatory essays.  Please note that we're not looking for a dictionary definition, but rather an elucidation of the term as we have used it in the context of the class: in our discussions, in our readings, and in our individual research. You will be expected to cite relevant authors (though not exact quotes or page numbers) as well as class discussions.

**30% final paper / project**

A final paper of 8-10 pages (due **May #**) will engage with theoretical questions raised throughout the course and readings both from the syllabus and potentially of the student's own choosing.  Because so much of the grade rests on this final paper, I encourage you to use your CourseWorks writing assignments to rehearse your arguments and speak with me throughout the term about your ideas.  Potential essay topics will be offered in advance. The student may also choose her own topic.
