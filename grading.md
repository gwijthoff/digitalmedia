**20% participation**

The importance of the works under discussion lies not in the works themselves, but rather in their interrelationship with our discussions and other media that you and I encounter in our daily lives. This means that class participation is vital to the success of this course. Simply attending class will not be enough to earn full participation credit. Instead, you must be an active participant, someone who comes prepared and engages with all aspects of the class.

**30% weekly posts**

Each week, students will post a brief update (~300 words) to the CourseWorks blog by 7:00am on Tuesday.  These posts can take the form of, among other things, a) an explanation, questioning, or complication of the week's readings, b) an interesting document or resource that you've found related to them, or c) an update on the progress of your midterm or final project.  This is simply a means of checking in with one another as we work through the ideas of the course.

**25% "Re-design" assignment**

One of the aims of this course is to explore the relationship between theory and practice. To this end, you will construct a "re-design" of an existing media system, due March 9.  These interventions can range from micro-level (e.g. proposing a particular tweak to the infrastructure of the Internet and tracing its consequences) to whole-cloth (e.g. envisioning an alternate peer-to-peer messaging system). You will situate this re-design amongst the readings read to this point, using the texts to help imagine the implications of your re-design.

The final form of this assignment should be a paper of 5 to 7 pages, properly referenced, and with additional media as necessary or desired.  Virtually any medium could work: paper prototypes, clay, painting, video, etc. You will additionally give an informal presentation of your re-design to the class (plan on approximately 5 minutes for the presentation and questions from the class).

**25% final project**

For your final project, you will select a specific digital device and trace the lifecycle of its manufacture, use, re-use, and disposal.  This is a very big task.  A single smartphone, for instance, contains over two hundred chemical compounds, and the scale of its production truly global: from rare-earth metal mines in Baotou, to data centers in Iowa, to grey markets in Jakarta, and electronics scrap yards in Delhi.  So, there are many different methods for going about this, many different pieces of the puzzle you can choose to focus on, and no two final projects will look alike.
